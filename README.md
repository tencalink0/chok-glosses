## Dev Help
### Creating courses
When you decide to create courses, you can either create them manually or get an AI to write them for you. If you decide to use AI, refer to the /prompts folder for a template of how to instruct the AI to write the course for you.

When assigning a color to a Level, you can either add the color as a string, or add a custom color:
| Color | Hex |
| -- | -- |
| --red | #ffddee |
| --green | #d0f0c0 |
| --purple | #c1c1f4 |
| --orange | #f8d7b5 |
| --yellow | #fff9c4 |
|  --blue | #cce5ff |

### ------------ Planned ------------
### LocalStorage 
For storing audio tracks and image, they are stored as "|file", with a "|" infront. This is used for preventing them having reserved names.
