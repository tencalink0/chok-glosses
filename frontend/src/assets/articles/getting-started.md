## Overview
Chok Glosses is aimed towards decentralised control, and giving everyone the right to learn languages. 
For this reason, all courses in the **Shop** section are free. 

Alongside this, we tried our best to create a versatile framework for others to use for creating their own courses.

## First Steps
When you first load Chok Glosses, you will be greeted with an Error page. This is normal!

From here, you need to either visit the **Shop** and purchase a new course or import your own custom course.

Then, to return back to the home page, just click the logo.

And Voilaa, before you know it, you can begin learning...

## Navigating Around
The general layout has been simplified as much as possible to avoid confusion.

Here is a list of the fundemental pages *(to get by)* with an explanation for what each one does:
- **Homepage** [ / ]: The complete course progress outlined with levels
- **Practice** [ /practice ]: A section to practice the levels which were the weakest *(Only Flashcards are supported so far)* <!-- TODO: once done, remove -->
- **Courses** [ /courses ]: A list of all the purchased and downloaded courses
- **Upload** [ /upload ]: A portal to upload custom courses created by others
- **Shop** [ /shop ]: The place to purchase your new courses
- **Login** [ /login ]: *Not working yet* but this will be completed soon <!-- TODO: once done, remove -->
